## Connectors

# Breadboard/protoboard wiring
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Standard breadboards use 22 AWG (solid-core) "hook-up" wires to connect-up
circuits elements together:
- 6 spools: <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1311>
- 10 spools: <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3174>

# Dupont cables: the next step up:
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
It seems like the next step up from using 22AWG cables on breadboards is to use
cables terminated with "Dupont connectors".

Pre-made Dupont "jumper wires":

# Advanced maker connectors:
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
This section lists connectors popular with current maker boards, and their
application. More information can be found here:
- <https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/stemma-qt-comparison>
- Good video show/tell (few types only): üéûÔ∏è<https://youtu.be/tBipTe69x-o?t=91>
- More reading: <https://www.tomshardware.com/features/stemma-vs-qwiic-vs-grove-connectors>

‚ö†Ô∏èWarning
- Not all devices expect the same signal levels/power to be delivered on their
  connectors. Typical operating voltages in use at the time of writing are 5V
  and 3.3V. Please ensure proper level match/shifting is in order.
- Not all formats work together. Please refer to:<br>

<a name="CrimpingTools_RJ45"></a>
# RJ-45 ("ethernet") crimping tools \& connectors
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
For all-around flexibility. [See section on Networking Connectors](ConnectorsNetworking.md).

Advantages:
- Cables are everywhere/easy to find.
- Larger size (easier to manipulate) - yet relatively compact.
- Comes in a bundle.
- Twisted into pairs to limit interference (assuming differential signalling).
- Cheap/easy to build.
- Keystone jacks are readily available \< [VCELiNK-Keystone] \>.
  <br>==> Can even use surface boxes as project boxes: \< [InfiniteCables-SurfaceBox] \>
  <br>==> And integrate with other Keystone connectors: \< [PrimeCables-KeystoneAV] \>

‚ö†Ô∏èWarning/Dangers:
- Custom RJ-45 cables invites people to plug your ciruit into something it shouldn't
  connected to (ex: your PC's ethernet jack).
- Preferable to use standard wiring scheme whenever possible.
- Preferable to label anything non-standard in an obvious way.

# Crimping tools for other connectors:
‚ö†Ô∏èWarning:
- There is a dizzying number of different crimping tools that work with
  different types of connector ends.
- Information on which are which crimping tools works well with which connector
  appears to be misleading, sparse and/or difficult to find.
- Not sure why finding a matching tool for a given connector type is so
  difficult - especially given that makers mostly stick to a finite subset of
  the same connectors.

Example of some crimpers... just not sure which ones work:
- "Universal" Crimpers: (Adafruit): <https://www.adafruit.com/category/622>

I personally tried the SN-28B tool (typ. blue handles). I would say no one die
is the right size for any of the JST connectors mentionned here (physically too
large/long). Also: it does not include a single "round"/"O" die - which is
apparently a requirement for crimping Dupont connectors. So I am still lost
when it comes to the intended purpose of the SN-28B tool (what does it crimp?)
given how popular it appears to be.

### Searching for compatible crimping tools
Here, I list some information that seems to point to what is needed to
crimp these small connectors:
- [Adafruit-JSTDatasheet]
- PA-24 (Engineering Tools): <https://www.engineertools-jp.com/pa24>
  - [Direct link to JST "Application chart"](https://www.nejisaurus.engineer.jp/_files/ugd/104650_594335d26d724883affcaa8929df7c19.pdf)
  - [Talks about "M" vs "O"-shaped dice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSq1LYbP0KA)
- [MWCP-PA24]

The information collected skews towards the PA-24 pliers. Not sure if that is red herring.

### Working crimping tool for JST+Dupont found!!!
This crimping tool ([Preciva PR-3254][Preciva-JSTDupont]) seems to work very
well with both JST \& Dupont connectors.
- The die thickness matches the connectors well... and don't crush the
  retention pin (if pulled snug).
- The ratchet does not bend the connectors backwards (in my experience).
- Has "O" shaped die - which Engineer tools indicates as better/required.
- BUT... required tightening of adjustment screw to ensure pull resistance.
  (then again - that's what adjustment screws are for).

### How to crimp
It takes a bit of practice. Videos on how to crimp properly are difficult to
find. Subtle issues with different techiques can cause problems. The most
obvious is using the wrong tool for the wrong job (poor documentation,
exaggerated compatibility claims, etc).

Here are a few useful videos:
- [Chapster-Crimping] (Similar technique to Dupont/others).
  - ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning: I would avoid using a hobby knife to release connector pins.
    Please find something safer.
- [Adafruit-Crimping]

Tips üëç:
- Always remove connectors from the metal strip backing - unless your crimps
  are specifically designed for them. On typical crimps: metal strips interfere
  with either the proper positioning of the connector pin... or the travel
  distance of the crimp jaws/dies.
