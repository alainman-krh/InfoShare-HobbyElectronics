## Development platforms
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Development platofrms provide convenient software "components" (API) to make
it easier to interact with the hardware components. Ideally/typically, the API
is written such that all hardware interactions require similar glue code.

# Popular platforms
Here are some the more popular development platforms at this time:
- **[Arduino] platform** ([Docs][Arduino-Docs]/[Download][Arduino-Download]):
  C++ programming. Runs very fast, uses little memory. C++ is more difficult to
  master - although simpler Arduino sketches (DEFINE/better word) are fairly
  easy to understand.
- **`MicroPython` platform** ([uPy]/[Docs][uPy-Docs]/[Download][uPy-Download]):
  Efficient (small+fast) Python implementation targeting microcontroller
  platforms. Python is typically slower than C++, and requires more memory to
  both store programs, and run. That said: programming in python is noticeably
  faster, and the learning curve is not nearly as steep.

  - [Optimizations](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/optimizations.html)
- **`CircuitPython` platform** ([CktPy]/[Docs][CktPy-Docs]/[Download][CktPy-Download]):
  A fork (derivative) of MicroPython [Adafruit][Adafruit-Learn]. Tries to
  extend MicroPython to improve on ease-of-use. Some aspects are not quite
  interoperable with native Micropython API/solutions.
  - \*Pre-compiled [Library Bundles](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) are also available for CircuitPython.
  - At time of writing: Missing multi-core support & interrupt programming (unlike MicroPython).
