# Hardware platforms (Development boards)
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Talk about more than dev board. Breakouts are "macro-scale" platforms for makers.
Most ICs now are too small for manuiplation by hand. Assembled by pick/place machines.
Electronics manufacturing works best at large volumes.

...So these are ideal hardware platforms for makers!

Talk about formfactors.

Many companies below support form factors originally developped by others.

Adafruit:
- Feather, Metro
- Circuit Playground: Target learning in schools (STEAM)
- [Trinkets](https://www.adafruit.com/category/261) (+ ItsyBitsy, Trinkey, Metro Mini, ...)
- **QT Py**: Tiny! Uses XIAO form-factor.
(There are many!)

Arduino
- Nano: Small form factor
- MKR:
- Classic:
- Mega:
